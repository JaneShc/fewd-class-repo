## Project Description

My final FEWD project will be a personal page of my data-related work. I will aim to showcase a portfolio of projects spanning data software, data coding work, and print / drawing, each living on its own page built to suit it (style / theme will carry throughout). From a coding standpoint, it will feature interactive graphs / maps (D3 & javascript), embedded experiences (Tableau, Instagram posts), and  images of non-digital work.

## Wireframes

1 very simple central / main page consisting of a few lines of 'title' text and a ul with links out to all projects.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP 

- Add user auth

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous  phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## jQuery Discoveries
 Use this section to list some, but not all, of the jQuery methods and\or functionality discovered while working on this project.
